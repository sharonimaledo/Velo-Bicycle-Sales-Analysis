# Velo Bicycle Sales Performance and Seasonality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory analysis of multi-year bicycle sales data completed as part of a Business Intelligence Analyst technical assessment. The objective is to evaluate sales performance across countries, products, and time, identify patterns in revenue, volume, and seasonality, and assess the impact of the 2008 Lehman Brothers financial crisis on sales behavior.
All analysis was conducted in Power BI, with Power Query used for data cleaning and transformation, followed by interactive dashboard development to support insight generation and decision-making.

## Key Insights 
- Germany demonstrates consistent revenue growth, driven by increasing quantities sold and higher average selling prices.
- U.S. revenue declined sharply during 2008–2009, reflecting reduced demand during the financial crisis, with gradual recovery in subsequent years.
- A small number of product categories generate the majority of revenue, while certain products consistently underperform.
- Off-Road Bikes contributed a significant share of 2011 sales, with select cities performing well above the average.
- Some products exhibit weak or absent seasonality, contrary to expected bicycle purchasing patterns.
